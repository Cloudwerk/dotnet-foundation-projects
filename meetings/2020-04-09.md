2. Open Source License Recommendations
- Board of Directors requested that the Project Committee submit a proposal related to the licenses which should be supported.
- Discussion ensued with a general suggestion that all OSI approved licenses could be supported
- Members of the committee expressed concern that copyleft licenses are not well understood in the industry
- Some members suggested that the .NET Foundation could offer education in this area
- A website was shared which does a good job of this already: https://choosealicense.com/
- Opinions were shared that many commercial organizations still avoid copyleft licenses
- It was noted that at one point in time the .NET Foundation had stated that it was focused on "commercial friendly" open source which would seem to indicate permissive licenses
